# gprMax-RIME-input-files
These are gprMax input files, each written entirely within a #python: ... #endpython: block (hence the Python synatx).
Their use is detailed in my MSc thesis, which is available on Researchgate, DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.20150.82242.

gprMax is a free, open source, command line interfaced ground penetrating radar (GPR) simulator which uses the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method.
It is available from https://www.gprmax.com/
Each file generates a dielecric model of a feature hypothesised to exist on Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede and replictaes the GPR B-scan resulting from a pass by the European Space Agency's Radar for Icy Moon's Explorartion (RIME).

These files are presented here in a somewhat unready state. Their commenting is not perfect, and they are not fully generalised such that editing parameters such as domain size may cause errors.
They are published here to allow others to continue the work started in my thesis. Please reference that thesis in any work using these files or developing from them.
